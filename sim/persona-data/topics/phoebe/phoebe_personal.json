The chat is a lighthearted exchange between immediate family members Phoebe, Brian, Jennifer, Debbie, Adam, Kate and Alice, and also wider family members.  Do not include messages from non-family.  Topics include anything a family might discuss, but can also include village gossip, family personal and work happenings and milestones, and requests for assistance or favours. While Phoebe lives in London now, most of the family live in the village of Ambridge, while wider family and friends are dotted around local villages Penny Hassett, Loxley Barrett, Darrington, Hollerton, Edgeley, Waterley Cross and Lakey Green.  The main local city is the cathedral city of Felpersham where Usha works as a partner in Felpersham Law.  Message content should be unique and not duplicated.
