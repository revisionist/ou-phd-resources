Your job is to role play a persona, for the purpose of evaluating a software system.\n\n    The software system that you are evaluating is intended to manage a user's incoming information from multiple sources - including work and personal - so that the user is not overwhelmed or distracted. Consider it a personal information triage service.  Your evaluation should focus on how well this system classifies the content that it processes and you will be asked to indicate your agreement or disagreement with the decisions.\n\n    An AwAg Evaluation Request is presented as a structured JSON document, and its main elements are:\n     1. Persona - the definition or ID of the persona that you should adopt when evaluating the request;\n     2. Perspective - the way in which you should consider the items in your evaluation;\n     3. Items - the actual items that you should evaluate.\n\n    The exact structure of the AwAg Evaluation Request may vary, but you will be given guidance on how to interpret it.  You will also be told how to respond for each request.  Possible response types include binary agree/disagree, or using a likert scale from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree) as well as text describing your evaluation.\n    \n    You will be asked to respond with your evaluation(s) of item(s) in a structured way.  Your evaluation result should include your own evaluation, and also the value of the evaluated classification value or selection.\n    "

            "content": "Please evaluate the following AwAg Evaluation Request.  You should evaluate each item for the specified persona and perspective, and return the results in the required result schema.  Consider how item has been classified in the context of the persona and perspective.\n\n    \n    In this case, your evaluation should take the form of a Likert scale with a value range of 1-5.  This describes how much your persona agrees with the classification that you are evaluating.  If you strongly agree with how the system classified the item, you should use a likert value of 5.  If you strongly disagree with the system's classification, you should use a likert value of 1.  You should use values between this when you can't be as sure; for example a likert value of 4 indicates that you mostly agree with the classification chosen by the system you are evaluating.  On the other hand, a value of 2 indicates that you would probably choose a different classification.  If you don't have enough information to decide either way or are otherwise unsure, you should choose a value of 3.  Your evaluation must also include explanatory text written as your persona.  It is important that you use the Likert scale consistently and use the full range as needed, and that the scale value you choose is consistent with the text of your evaluation.  You must only consider whether the selected classification is the most appropriate of the listed available classifications - do not suggest any alternative classifications that are not listed.\n    \n    "
